# About

{{ site.description }}

Made with Jekyll and a lot of Sass. Hosted via GitHub Pages, contributions to the repository welcome.

## Where did I get all this code from?

A lot of these effects come from other developers across the internet. To give credit where it's due, you'll see a link to the source material I stole / adapted the code from in the view source code section.

I've edited the code to meet my understanding of best practice and ensure it looks good across different formats.
