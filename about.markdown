# About

Made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I used [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling the links. All source code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/jhancock532/link-hover-effects).

Any feedback or code review would be very much appreciated, either send me a tweet or raise an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jhancock532/link-hover-effects).

### Making Good Animation Choices

- Ideally, only transition the `opacity` and `transform` CSS properties for best browser performance. Avoid repainting large areas of the screen or triggering many layout updates.

- To avoid causing nausea symptoms in people with vestibular disorders, don't use animations that cover large parts of the screen, animations that quickly cover large distances, or animations with simultaneous motion in different directions.

- Avoid flashing animations as well, as those can be triggers for folks with epilepsy and migraines.

Advice copied from [Eli Fitch's](http://eli.wtf/) great [presentation on web animation](http://assets.eli.wtf/talks/animation-talk-webu-2018/#/34?presenter).
